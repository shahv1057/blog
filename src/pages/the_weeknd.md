### Intro

The Weeknd has had an incredible amount of success over the last few years. Songs like "Earned It", "The Hills", "Can't Feel My Face", "Starboy", "I Feel It Coming", and many more songs have dominated top charts on popular streamig services like Spotify and Apple Music. His mix of Pop, Hip Hop, and R&B has clearly left a mark.

What is it about The Weeknd's music that has skyrocketed his voice? The soothing smoothness of his iconic voice? Perhaps it is his incredible vocal range. 

I used to believe that he possessed some intangible characteristic that really couldn't be explained. However, after starting to learn about **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** I began to question that thought. Was there an analytical method behind understanding The Weeknd's musical brilliance and streaming success? How has his music evolved over time? How does his music differ from songs from other similar artists?

### Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing, or NLP, refers to the process of using a computer to read, understand, and extract useful analytical data from human language. How do you detect a mood from a sentence, paragraph, or in this post's case, a song?
