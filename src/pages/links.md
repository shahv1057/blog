4th Down. 1 yard to the endzone. ~30 seconds left in the half of the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles have a choice to either kick a relatively easy field goal and take 3 points, or go for the touchdown and risk coming away with nothing before the half.

That iconic situation preceded perhaps the most memorable play in recent Super Bowl history, "The Philly Special". However, there was a similarly important and less known 4th Down choice that the Eagles had later in that game. 4th Down and 2 on the PHI 45, 5:39 left in the 4th quarter down 33-32. In this situation, the stakes where higher and the margin of error was lower so late in the game.

So should the Eagles go for it? If so, should they pass it or run it? What  type of play should the Patriots defense have expected in that situation?

These questions can be answered through coaches' debates, understanding of the game, or even the subjective feel. Doug Pederson, the Eagles coach, ignored all of these and instead chose data. What does the data say?

To answer that, we're going to need to take a closer look:
