<h2>Introduction</h2>

Through the beginning of August, there have been more than **4.5 million cases** and **150 thousand deaths** recorded in the United States of America as a result of COVID-19. After beginning its spread through Washington and California in early March, the virus has quickly spread throughout the country, initally finding its epicenter in New York City in April and May, before spreading quickly in a second wave throughout Texas, Florida, Arizona, and several other countries in the southern United States. The visualizations below numerically and geographically display the areas more and less inflicted by the virus, and specifically which states and counties the virus has spread through over the last several months.
